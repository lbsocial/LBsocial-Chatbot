# **LBSocial Chatbot**  

This project integrates an **AI-powered chatbot** into [LBSocial.net](https://lbsocial.net) using **Wix Chat and OpenAI Assistants API**. The chatbot retrieves answers from **LBSocial's YouTube video captions**, making it an **interactive learning assistant** for data analytics and AI topics.  

## **Video Tutorial**

For a step-by-step guide on setting up this chatbot, watch: ðŸ“Œ **[LBSocial Chatbot Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/kRlqZzLfKSc)**

## **How the Chatbot Works**  

1. **Retrieve Video Captions from YouTube**  
   - A Python script ([`video_captions_retrive.ipynb`](video_captions_retrive.ipynb)) **fetches YouTube captions** using the YouTube API.  
   - The script was generated by **ChatGPT** and automates caption extraction.  
   - You can find LBSocial's YouTube videos here: [LBSocial YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwtRYX-OsUj4VHLic2XQYog).  

2. **Upload Captions to OpenAI Vector Store**  
   - The extracted captions are **manually uploaded** to OpenAI as a **vector database** for retrieval.  

3. **OpenAI Assistant Processes Queries**  
   - An **OpenAI Assistant** is manually configured to **retrieve relevant captions** from the vector store.  
   - The AIâ€™s **response instructions** were generated by **ChatGPT** to ensure accurate replies.  
   - Learn more about OpenAI Assistants here: [OpenAI Assistants Overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview).  
   
   - **Thread-Based Conversations**: The assistant creates a unique **thread** for each user to maintain context during interactions, allowing for more personalized and relevant responses.  
   
4. **Wix Chatbot Implementation**  
   - A **Wix Chatbot** is deployed on **LBSocial.net**, enabling users to interact with the AI.  
   - **Frontend and backend files** for the chatbot were created using **ChatGPT**, referencing the YouTube tutorial:  

     ðŸ“Œ **[How to Turn the Native Wix Chat (App Market) into ChatGPT with OpenAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vn5fQjx4Y8&t=690s)**  
   
   - **User-Dedicated Channels**: On Wix, each user has a **dedicated channel**, ensuring chat history is organized and easily accessible for continued interactions.  
   
   - **Benefits of Thread-Based and Channel-Based Conversations**:  
     - **Personalized Experience**: Since the assistant tracks individual conversations, users receive more tailored responses.  
     - **Context Retention**: Instead of starting from scratch every time, the assistant remembers the context of past interactions.  
     - **Seamless Integration**: Users on Wix can continue discussions in their dedicated chat channels without losing important insights.
